<p align="center"> helloooo!

<p align="center"> i joke around and talk too much, please let me know if you are uncomfortable and if theres something about me or my personality that you do not like. i will change my behavior accordingly without question. i'd like if you be direct about it too! communication is key

<p align="center "> any ship can interact, i also love c+h even if not stated—any touch is okay! 

<p align="center"> i don't mind inspo, whether light or heavy, just please ask beforehand! what i dont like is when you're a complete obvious copy of my pony

<p align="center"> i am a VERY huge social butterfly, dont feel scared interacting with me! i also like coming up to c+h people, and whispering anyone i please whenever im bored (despite this statement, please understand that i do not have the best social battery at all times. i may come off as dry/annoyed with others. i am not always in the mood to talk; do not pester me or force me to do anything)

>will kiss all dandy cosplays i see, apologies if it's made anyone uncomfortable. i will read byi's/boundaries before i do, though

>cant believe i have to say this now but all of my ponies will have my github. please dont fall for copycats!
