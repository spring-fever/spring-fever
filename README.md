$${\color{green}"Let ‎ me ‎ tell ‎ you ‎ about ‎ the ‎ cutest ‎ thing ‎ my ‎ little ‎ pet ‎ rock ‎ did ‎ yesterday!"}$$

$${\color{green}"Hahaha! ‎ ISN'T ‎ THAT ‎ FUNNY!!!"}$$


<p align="center"> Hello to you, and to you, and of course, you!

<p align="center"> I joke around and talk too much, please let me know if you are uncomfortable and if theres something about me or my personality that you do not like. I will change my behavior accordingly without question. I'd like if you be direct about it too! Communication is key

<p align="center "> I am very c+h friendly; if you see me alone, feel free to come over! But, if I'm with friends, please ask.

<p align="center"> I don't mind inspo, whether light or heavy, just please ask beforehand! What I don't like is when you're a complete obvious copy of my pony

<p align="center"> I am a VERY huge social butterfly, dont feel scared interacting with me! I also like coming up to c+h people, and whispering anyone I please whenever I'm bored (despite this statement, please understand that I do not have the best social battery at all times. I may come off as dry/annoyed with others. I am not always in the mood to talk; do not pester me or force me to do anything)

>Can't believe I have to say this now but all of my ponies will have my GitHub. Please dont fall for copycats!

$${\color{yellow}"If ‎ I ‎ could ‎ live ‎ in ‎ third ‎ person..."}$$

$${\color{yellow}"—Well, ‎ I ‎ don't ‎ think ‎ life ‎ would ‎ be ‎ much ‎ worse ‎ than ‎ it ‎ is."}$$
